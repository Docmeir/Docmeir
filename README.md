Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for cooking, cool tech and exploring nature. I enjoy working on anything involving Software Development, Cloud Engineering or Robotics. Be it work, personal projects or just tinkering, I find the creative process of building something from scratch to be incredibly rewarding.
