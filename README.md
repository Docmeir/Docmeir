I love hacking and building ideas into reality using all aspects of engineering.  
From code to cloud and everything in between. If there is a problem, there are 10 different solutions.  The fun is figuring out which one is the best fit.

I'm always staying current with the latest technologies and learning new ways to use the battle-tested ones.
Check out my site or connect on socials to talk about cool tech and the latest ideas.
