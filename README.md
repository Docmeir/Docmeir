üëã **Hi, I'm Derek!**

As a **Architect and Full Stack Developer**, I'm always learning new technologies and how to apply them to practical business applications.  The world is an ever-changing state with new cloud services and technologies that allow for innovative solutions to new and old problems. The ability to design and deploy the right solution using the services, technologies, and tools available at your disposal is in my mind.  The greatest set of Legos a person could ever want.  Finding the most cost-effective and efficient solution is actually the fun part for me.  It allows a great level of creativity which is the cornerstone of my work, breathing life into each project with a unique perspective and fresh ideas.
