Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology, finance, and nature. I find the creative process of building something from idea to reality to be incredibly rewarding. When I'm not coding, I love experimenting in the kitchen and exploring the great outdoors.

My development focuses include Python, .NET, Azure Cloud Services, Fintech, Data Science, and AI. I'm always eager to expand my skills and knowledge through work and personal projects.  

I'm always open to collaboration and new opportunities.
