ðŸ‘‹ **Hey, I'm Derek!**

I'm your go-to guy for turning tech ideas into reality. Tech's my playground â€“ from architectural designs, crafting code or deploying at scale in the cloud. I love unraveling tech puzzles and believe in multiple paths to a solution. It's not just about building or fixing things; it's about finding the best way to do it. 

ðŸ›  **What's My Jam:**
- Staying on top of the latest trends in development, tools and cloud advancements.
- Combining trusted battle tested tech with new ideas for something awesome.
- Experimenting in my home labs

ðŸ“¢ **Let's Connect:**

Got a tech puzzle or just want to chat about the latest in tech? Swing by my site or hit me up on socials. Let's talk tech and make things happen!
