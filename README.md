ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I am a software developer with a passion for cooking, drones and exploring nature.  I also enjoy working on anything invovling Software Development, Automation, Self-Hosting or Cloud Engineering. Be it work, personal projects or just daily tasks I'm automating. I truly love being able to hit the "big red easy button" ðŸ”´.  It's the spirit of innovation and birthplace of ideas.


My motto is, if you can dream it, you can build it.
