👋 Hey there!

I have a passion for everything Cloud Engineering, Software Development, and Automation. Be it projects or just daily tasks.  I truly love being able to hit the "big red easy button" 🔴

My motto is, if you can dream it, you can build it.

I'm currently working on Software Development projects utilizing Python, Bash, TCL and AWS Cloud Services.  Focusing on Agile CI/CD methodology in Scalable Cloud Deployments. 🚀☁
